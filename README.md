# Pong Slayer
Here lies a smart pong player agent made in Python and trained during more than 24 hours on more than 5000 games. It's a Reinforcement Learning agent made based on the Policy Gradient algorithm. The whole process is also explained in this [blog](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/). Feel free to look at it to understand more about it.

# How to make it work ?

## Get the Requirements
- Let's start by..  **Installing Python**. In case you haven't seen it yet, this repository is made in python.
- After that, you can clone this repository.

      git clone https://github.com/6fried/pong_slayer
    
- Now go to the directory of your local repository and run this command in your teminal

      python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

You are now ready to enjoy your Smart Agent

## Enjoy your Pong Slayer
The main goal of the repository is to showcase how the agent is made. We've also included a main function to train and test you own agent. And if you don't have time to go through all this training stuff, you can just use our pre-made agent whose brain is save in a `.xxx` file. So you're free to use the Agent code or if you're there for examination, you'll be more interested in the demo, so just run the main program.

### Using the Agent in your own logic
All the agent workflow is detailed in the main function it's clear enough to understand.

### Training existing agent with the program
    python main.py -t/--train [nbr_ep] path/to/the/agent/brain
where `nbr_ep` is the number of episodes you want your agent to be trained on, and `path/to/the/agent/brain` is the path to your agent's brain file.

### Evaluate your agent
    python main.py -e  nbr_ep path/to/the/agent/brain
where `nbr_ep` is the number of episodes you want your agent to be trained on, and `path/to/the/agent/brain` is the path to your agent's brain file.

To do both training and evaluation, you have to add both `-t` and `-e`.

    python main.py -t [nbr_ep] -e nbr_ep path/to/the/agent/brain
If you want your program to load an existing Slayer, you have to use de `-r` option or `--resume`.

**Happy Pong Slay !ðŸ¤—**
