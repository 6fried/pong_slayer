# Smart Pong Player
Here lies a smart pong player agent made in Python and trained during more than 24 hours on more than 5000 games. It's a Reiforment Learning agent made based on the Policy Gradient algorithm. The whole process is also explained in this [blog](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/). Feel free to look at it to understand more about the process.

# How to make it work ?
## Requirements
- The Atari module from OpenAI's gymnasium library. It also requires a rom license to make the games work.
<code>python -m pip install gymnasium[atari]
python -m pip install gymnasium[accept-rom-licenses]<code>
